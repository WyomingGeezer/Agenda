Agenda
======

It's an Arduino compatible Scheduler library. There are a lot of libraries like this one on github, but I needed an overflow proof implementation I could trust for HAB (High Altitude Balloon) launches and home automation experiments. Agenda is immune to `millis()` overflow and it is designed to work rock solid.
